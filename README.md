Who's Sitting Behind The Name 'JoiFoi'? 🤔
-------------------------------------
👋 Hey There! it's JoiFoi (Not so surprising after checking my github username, huh? 😗)

🌱 I started programming at an early age... Perhaps it's safe to say I wrote my first lines of code when I was somewhat around 14.
Well, I'm not 14 anymore (That doesn't mean I don't wish I were 13 🤧)... But times's passed and **I hope** I've gotten better comparing to my early days.

😕 Anyway... Github's where I like to post my projects and follow other open-source software. 🐍 Days are passing in a snake routine. I guess I'm not the only one obsessed with Python, huh?

🗣 Contact me on Telegram. I'm working on [a Python pack to design Telegram bots with](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot); So i'm pretty much working there all the time these days.
