Who's Sitting Behind The Name 'JoiFoi'? 🤔
-------------------------------------
👋 Hey There! it's JoiFoi (Not so surprising after checking my github username, huh? 😗)

🌱 I started programming at an early age... Perhaps it's safe to say I wrote my first lines of code when I was somewhat around 14.
Well, I'm not 14 anymore (That doesn't mean I don't wish I were 14 🤧)... But times's passed and **I hope** I've gotten better comparing to my early days.

🤠 Was I born to become a web developer? Yayyyy! (Who am I kidding? big NO...) Well I'm not saying I never had a thing for web development... I always liked it. Let's just say watching movies and listening to music is what I do on my free time; But I just enjoy them so much that I feel like I always had a thing for them that could grow and become my passion... Well that didn't happen and I'm not unhappy about it. I can't imagine a day without coding, Feels like an addiction these days 😀

😕 Anyway... Github's where I like to post my projects and follow other open-source software. 🐍 Days are passing in a snake routine. I guess I'm not the only one obsessed with Python, huh?

🗣 Contact me on Telegram. I'm working on [a Python pack to design Telegram bots with](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot); So i'm pretty much working there all the time these days.
